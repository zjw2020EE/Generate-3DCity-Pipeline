"""
Raster processing package.

Orientation contract:
- All public functions accept and return 2D grids using the canonical internal
  orientation "north_up": row 0 is the northern/top row.
- Where data sources use south_up, conversions are performed internally; outputs
  are always north_up unless explicitly documented otherwise.
- Columns increase eastward (col 0 = west/left), indices increase to the east.
